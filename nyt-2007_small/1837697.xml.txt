Big States Weigh In

Statewide surveys conducted by Quinnipiac University in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania reveal that a significant number of voters do not yet have opinions of Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, and Mitt Romney, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts.
        Democratic voters have a more favorable impression of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York than they do of John Edwards, the former North Carolina senator. Republican voters have more favorable views of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, than they do of Senator John McCain of Arizona.
        Florida and Pennsylvania have joined the recent rush by states to try moving their primaries earlier in the process; Ohio's primary is set for the first Tuesday in March.
