Tallying Votes, Not Money

Now, back to the voters.
        As the presidential campaigns calculate their first-quarter financial reports -- working overtime to interpret their results favorably -- the candidates turn their attention back to campaigning and signing up rank-and-file supporters.
        On the Republican side, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York makes his inaugural visits to New Hampshire and Iowa. Former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts fires up his ''Ask Mitt Anything'' forums. And Senator John McCain of Arizona returns from a trip to Iraq. Two new candidates officially in the race -- Tommy G. Thompson, the former Wisconsin governor, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman -- begin testing their respective messages in early voting states.
        Among the Democrats, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York travels through eastern Iowa. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois talks health care in New Hampshire. And John Edwards of North Carolina returns to Iowa with his wife, Elizabeth, for the first time since she announced that her cancer had returned. Senators Joseph R. Biden of Delaware and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut also have full schedules.
        This week, during a Congressional spring break, the presidential candidates whose day jobs normally are on Capitol Hill have been given a reprieve from flying back to Washington to cast votes. So the candidates have loaded their schedules with meeting voters in early primary states. But by week's end, virtually all the contenders have the same itinerary etched into their calendar: a vacation day or two for Easter.
