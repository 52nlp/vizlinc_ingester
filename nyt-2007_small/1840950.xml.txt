Starting to Address the Big Questions

For those who crave a little substance -- impatient with the often who's-up, who's-down nature of the presidential campaign -- the time has come. These days, it is hard to take a step without bumping into a candidate delivering a major policy address and seeking to establish credentials on the big issues. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, talked yesterday in Memphis about his economic policies. A speech by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, on ''women and leadership'' at Rutgers was postponed because of the weather. Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, is speaking about foreign policy today in Chicago, and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts will deliver what he bills as a major address tomorrow in Washington. His campaign is keeping the topic a secret. And if it's Thursday, it must be Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, talking about energy.
