MoveOn.org, the liberal online advocacy group, will hold a virtual town hall meeting tonight in which six Democratic presidential candidates will take questions on Iraq from MoveOn members. Afterwards, members will vote for their favorite by e-mail or cellphone text message.
        ''It's 'American Idol' meets American politics,'' said Trevor FitzGibbon, a spokesman for MoveOn.
        Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton, Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden Jr., Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Gov. Bill Richardson and former Senator John Edwards will join in, either live or on videotape. Three Republican candidates -- Senator John McCain, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mitt Romney -- declined to participate.
        The meeting will be broadcast on the group's Web site and on some radio stations that carry Air America programming. MoveOn plans similar events, on health care and energy policy, this spring.
