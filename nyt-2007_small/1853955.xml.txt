Months Before First Votes, Another Kind of Counting

The first primary votes are still more than half a year off, but the next installment of an important proxy contest -- the money primary -- is only weeks away. So the presidential candidates are all shaking the money tree this week, hoping for impressive tallies after the second quarter-reporting period ends June 30.
        Several candidates are prospecting in California, including Senator Barack Obama, Mitt Romney and Senator John McCain.
        John Edwards tried something a little different for his birthday Sunday. His campaign posted a video on YouTube of two of his top aides, Joe Trippi and Jonathan Prince, baking him a pecan pie and asking donors to give $6.10 to commemorate the date of his birth, $19.53 for the year he was born or $54 to match his age. The campaign said it took in a quarter of a million dollars from 10,000 donors.
        Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is expected to raise more than $2 million this week using more tried and true methods, according to a recent internal fund-raising memorandum, with events in Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington, and in Oklahoma and Texas. Rudolph W. Giuliani has events set in Pennsylvania this week.
        Money matters, and not only for what it can buy. Mr. McCain's weak first-quarter showing created the perception that his campaign was struggling; Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama got a bounce from their strong showings. Now the campaigns are trying to manage expectations for the second quarter, to put the best spin on whatever the bottom line shows.
