Sounding Presidential at Graduation

It is cap-and-gown season, and for the presidential candidates, that means the opportunity to spend May weekends delivering speeches at colleges and universities that are carefully selected to fit a strategic purpose.
        Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and a Republican whose Mormon faith has given some Christian evangelicals pause, chose to deliver a commencement speech on Saturday in Virginia at Regent University, which was founded by the evangelist Pat Robertson. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, is focusing on black institutions, perhaps a reflection of how she and Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, are scrambling for black voters. Last Saturday, she gave the commencement address at Wilberforce University in Ohio. Later this month, she will speak at the historically black Dillard University in New Orleans, where she can address the student body in a city whose devastation she often cites in assailing the Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina.
        Mr. Obama chose the nation's first primary state for a commencement address. He will speak on May 19 at Southern New Hampshire University.
        And where did Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican and former New York mayor, announce that he wanted to increase the Army's troop strength by tens of thousands of soldiers? He chose the Citadel military college in South Carolina, above, where his address was warmly received Saturday.
