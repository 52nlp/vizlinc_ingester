Not-So-Friendly Skies

It is about 1,100 miles from Des Moines to Manchester, N.H., with no direct flights except by private jet. And thanks to new Congressional ethics rules, the trip may feel much longer to some presidential candidates.
        Federal election laws allow candidates to use corporate jets and reimburse the owners at the lower cost of a first-class commercial ticket. But recently passed Senate rules would prohibit members, including Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton, Barack Obama and John McCain, from getting the discount. The details will not be clear until the bill returns from a House-Senate conference, and it could ban all federal candidates from getting the discount. But many, including Mr. McCain, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, have already given it up.
        For now, the situation may give an edge to candidates outside the Senate: former Senator John Edwards, above, among Democrats, or former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York among Republicans.
        Mr. Romney's campaign recently sent an appeal to supporters explaining the federal law and asking for the use of private planes. ''One key way in which we can cut costs is by increasing our pool of private planes,'' the campaign's finance director wrote.
