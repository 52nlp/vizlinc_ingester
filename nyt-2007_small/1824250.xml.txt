Giuliani Steps Closer To a Run in 2008

Rudolph W. Giuliani took another step toward running for president by filing a ''statement of candidacy'' with the Federal Election Commission yesterday, declaring that he would seek the Republican nomination if he runs, according to his campaign.
        Appearing last night on the Fox News Channel program ''Hannity &amp; Colmes,'' Mr. Giuliani just skirted the line on declaring his candidacy. ''We still have to formally announce it and do a few more things,'' he said, but added that yesterday's paperwork ''is about as close as you're going to get.''
        When asked if he would beat Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton if he won the Republican nomination, he said, ''I'm in this to win.'' Then he added, ''You do this because you believe that you can win the nomination of your party, and then you believe that you're the strongest candidate to win the election for your party.''
        Mr. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, is also amending a document he already filed with the commission, dropping the phrase ''testing the waters'' from his application, officials on his campaigns said.
        Compared with his top rivals in 2008 at this point, Senator John McCain of Arizona and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, Mr. Giuliani has moved more slowly to hire staff members and build a state-by-state political organization.
        An aide to Mr. Giuliani said the new filing with the election commission was mostly housekeeping work, bringing Mr. Giuliani's paperwork into line with that of Mr. McCain's and Mr. Romney's.
